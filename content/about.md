## Now for the good stuff.

I have graduated Computer Science at "Alexandru Ioan Cuza" University of Ia»ôi, Romania. I currently have a bachelor's degree that I got in **2019** and a master's degree in "Computational Optimization" in **2022**.

I also have been working in the *Tech Industry* since I graduated in **2019** primarily as a *.Net Developer*. During the years I had the pleasure/displeasure to work with a number of
technologies revolving around the server-side of web applications.

What I know *(hoppefuly)* in depth :
  - K8s
  - .NET Framework/Core
  - DevOps
  - Source Control
  - Scalable/High Availability Architecture
  - Domain Driven Design
  - Linux
  - Virtualization
  - Networking
  - SQL/NoSQL

My primary software development language is **C#**. I also vaguely know a lot of shell languages like **bash** and random bits and pieces of **Java,C,C++,Perl,Go**. 

I also have developed an obsession with custom keyboards and everything that is self-hosted. This is also the main topic and reason of my [**open-source projects**](../projects/).
